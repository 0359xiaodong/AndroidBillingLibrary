Android Billing Library
By @robot_media

requestPurchase("com.example.item")

That's how simple it should be to use Android In-app Billing.

And with this library it is.

(or will be; this is a very early release)

Android Billing Library implements in-app billing's full specification and stores transactions in an obfuscated local database.

How to use
==========

Add this library to your project and subclass AbstractBillingActivity in the activity in which you want to use in-app billing. Or use BillingController directly and implement IBillingObserver and BillingController.IConfiguration if you need finer-grain control.
