Android Billing Library
By @robot_media

requestPurchase("com.example.item")

That's how simple it should be to use Android In-app Billing.

And with this library it is.

(or will be; this is a very early release)

Android Billing Library implements in-app billing's full specification and stores transactions in an obfuscated local database.

How to use
==========

1) Add this library to your project.

2) Subclass AbstractBillingActivity in the activity in which you want to use in-app billing. 

Or use BillingController directly and implement IBillingObserver and BillingController.IConfiguration if you need finer-grain control.

3) Open the AndroidManifest.xml of your application and add this permission...

<uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />

...and this service and receiver inside the application element:

<service android:name="net.robotmedia.billing.BillingService" />
<receiver android:name="net.robotmedia.billing.BillingReceiver">
	<intent-filter>
		<action android:name="com.android.vending.billing.IN_APP_NOTIFY" />
		<action android:name="com.android.vending.billing.RESPONSE_CODE" />
		<action android:name="com.android.vending.billing.PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED" />
	</intent-filter>
</receiver>

That's it!
